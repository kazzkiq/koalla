  <b>Koalla CLI 🐨</b>
  <br>
   A CLI for minimalist back-end projects.

<br><br>

## What is Koalla?

Koalla is a simple and lean project scaffolding for building Node.js Web APIs.

It aims to be a sane middleground between the dozen scattered options of super-opinionated back-end frameworks such as Nest.js and Adonis, and the super-loose "figure everything by yourself" standalone frameworks like Koa.js and Express.js.

There is nothing wrong with either super-opinionated or super-loose frameworks, but they're not for everybody.

If you like to have a sane base to build up your API, that gives you the basics to get going while also keeping all your freedom to change whatever you like, then Koalla may be a good fit for you.
